          This project was a front-end challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a
          platform that enables you to practice building websites to a design
          and project brief. Each challenge includes mobile and desktop designs
          to show how the website should look at different screen sizes.
          Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve
          real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each
          project, helping me to improve and adapt my style.
